# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 2025_

Replay ("the App") is an iOS application that enables users to import, view, and organise their personal Instagram Data Archive entirely offline. This Privacy Policy explains how Replay handles data.

Replay is built with privacy as a core principle. Your data remains on your device, unless you explicitly choose to use Replay+ CloudKit backup features.

## 1. Information We Collect

Replay collects no personal data by default. The App processes only the information you choose to import.

### 1.1 Instagram Archive Data

If you import your Instagram Data Archive ZIP, Replay reads and displays the content locally on your device.

This may include:

- Photos, videos, stories
- Captions and metadata
- Profile information
- Messages (if included)

Replay does not upload, transmit, or share this data unless you enable Replay+ Cloud Backup.

### 1.2 CloudKit (Replay+)

If you subscribe to Replay+, you may choose to back up your imported content to your personal iCloud using CloudKit.

CloudKit data is:

- Stored only in your private iCloud container
- Accessible only to your Apple ID
- Not accessible to the developer

### 1.3 Diagnostics (Optional)

If enabled, Apple may provide anonymised crash logs. Replay does not send or store diagnostic data directly.

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

Replay uses your imported content to:

- Display your archive
- Support search and browsing
- Handle backups/restore

Replay does not collect analytics, share data, or sell data.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Replay uses:

- Apple CloudKit
- Apple StoreKit for subscriptions

No advertising SDKs or external analytics.

## 4. Your Choices

You can delete your data, remove the App, disable iCloud, or cancel Replay+ at any time.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Replay is not targeted at children under 13.

## 6. Policy Changes

Updates will appear on this page.

## 7. Contact

support@eridianlabs.org

Replay is developed by Eridian Labs.

## 8. Data Retention

Replay does not retain any user data. All data remains on the user's device or in their private iCloud if they enable Replay+ Cloud Backup. Users may delete their data at any time by removing it from the App or uninstalling the App.
